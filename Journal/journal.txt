Week 1
To be fair, I only used AI to help me as a refresher on python concepts. I dont really need it as of now. 

Week 2
This week I used AI while working on the Week 2 Python exercises to better understand certain
coding concepts. For example, I asked clarifying questions about how to use loops to count the
number of checked-out books, how to stop a loop after finding the first available title, and how to
compare string lengths when finding the longest book title. I also asked about the logic behind
appending items to a new list while preserving order. The AI responses helped me reason through the
exercises and apply the logic myself, but I did not use AI to directly complete or submit the
solutions.

Week 3
This week I used AI while working on the Week 3 Python library exercises. I mostly used it to make sure I was on the right track with my code and to help me explain things in a simpler way. For example, I asked about what happens with list indexes, and how to flip True/False values in a list without messing it up. The AI helped me think about edge cases, and just gave me ideas for cleaner ways to do stuff. I still wrote and tested all the functions myself,  the AI was more like a helper to bounce questions off of.

Week 4
This week I used AI to help me better understand the object-oriented programming concepts in the
Week 5 Python exercises. I worked through problems that involved building classes, defining methods,
and managing attribute and I used AI to answer questions about what each exercise was really 
teaching — like when to use a class instead of a function, how self works, and why certain methods 
should return values instead of printing them. It helped me think more about how objects store and 
change data internally, and how methods like checkout() or add_to_queue() control an object’s state. 
Chat also helped me notice patterns between different exercises, like using lists versus 
dictionaries, or making comparisons case-insensitive for consistency. Essentially, AI helped me reflect on the logic behind each one and build a deeper understanding of how OOP works in Python.

This week I used AI to help with the 
Week 5 exercises on encapsulation and 
properties. I ran into a few errors, 
like an AttributeError about 
'_Member__email' in my Member class, 
and a ValueError when testing my 
BookCopy transitions. I asked AI why 
those were happening, and it explained 
how property setters actually create 
private variables and why I shouldn’t 
call the setter in the constructor. It 
also confirmed that using raise 
ValueError() was fine for this week’s 
scope. Overall, AI helped me understand the logic behind encapsulation and clean up my code.
