Week 1
To be fair, I only used AI to help me as a refresher on python concepts. I dont really need it as of now. 

Week 2
This week I used AI while working on the Week 2 Python exercises to better understand certain
coding concepts. For example, I asked clarifying questions about how to use loops to count the
number of checked-out books, how to stop a loop after finding the first available title, and how to
compare string lengths when finding the longest book title. I also asked about the logic behind
appending items to a new list while preserving order. The AI responses helped me reason through the
exercises and apply the logic myself, but I did not use AI to directly complete or submit the
solutions.
