Week 1
To be fair, I only used AI to help me as a refresher on python concepts. I dont really need it as of now. 

Week 2
This week I used AI while working on the Week 2 Python exercises to better understand certain
coding concepts. For example, I asked clarifying questions about how to use loops to count the
number of checked-out books, how to stop a loop after finding the first available title, and how to
compare string lengths when finding the longest book title. I also asked about the logic behind
appending items to a new list while preserving order. The AI responses helped me reason through the
exercises and apply the logic myself, but I did not use AI to directly complete or submit the
solutions.

Week 3
This week I used AI while working on the Week 3 Python library exercises. I mostly used it to make sure I was on the right track with my code and to help me explain things in a simpler way. For example, I asked about what happens with list indexes, and how to flip True/False values in a list without messing it up. The AI helped me think about edge cases, and just gave me ideas for cleaner ways to do stuff. I still wrote and tested all the functions myself,  the AI was more like a helper to bounce questions off of.

Week 4
This week I used AI to help me better understand the object-oriented programming concepts in the
Week 5 Python exercises. I worked through problems that involved building classes, defining methods,
and managing attribute and I used AI to answer questions about what each exercise was really 
teaching — like when to use a class instead of a function, how self works, and why certain methods 
should return values instead of printing them. It helped me think more about how objects store and 
change data internally, and how methods like checkout() or add_to_queue() control an object’s state. Chat also helped me notice patterns between different exercises, like using lists versus 
dictionaries, or making comparisons case-insensitive for consistency. Essentially, AI helped me reflect on the logic behind each one and build a deeper understanding of how OOP works in Python.

This week I used AI to help with the  Week 5 exercises on encapsulation and properties. I ran into a few errors, like an AttributeError about '_Member__email' in my Member class, and a ValueError when testing my BookCopy transitions. I asked AI why those were happening, and it explained how property setters actually create private variables and why I shouldn’t call the setter in the constructor. It also confirmed that using raise ValueError() was fine for this week’s scope. Overall, AI helped me understand the logic behind encapsulation and clean up my code.

Week 6
This week I used AI while working on the library project exercises about static methods and utility classes. I had some trouble understanding when to use @staticmethod versus regular methods, and how helper classes like Formatter or DateUtils fit into the program. I asked AI why my code was returning weird outputs like [<__main__.Book object at 0x…>], and it explained that I needed a __repr__ method to make the objects print nicely. It also helped me clean up some formatting issues and understand how class methods can organize shared logic. Overall, it made the concepts behind utility and catalog classes a lot clearer.

Week 7
This week I used AI to help me with the error handling and exceptions exercises. I asked about when to raise a ValueError vs. a TypeError and why we separate FileNotFoundError and JSONDecodeError in the same try block. AI explained how exceptions stop normal program flow and why it’s better to catch specific errors instead of a broad except. It also showed me how to use assertRaises() to test my error handling. Overall, it helped me write cleaner, safer code and actually understand what’s happening when something breaks.

Week 8
This week I used AI to help with the Week 8 exercises on classes, constructors, and instance variables. I was having trouble understanding how to properly define a constructor in my Book class and when to use the this keyword. I asked AI to explain how constructors initialize object data and why using this.title = title avoids confusion between instance and local variables. It also showed me how to create multiple Book objects with different values and how to print their details using a toString() method. Overall, AI helped me better understand how classes store data, how objects are created from them, and how methods interact with instance variables.

Week 9
This week, I used AI to help fix several issues in my Week 9 exercises on polymorphism and protocols. I was getting an AttributeError for validate_on_add(), and AI explained that I had overwritten the entire Catalog.add_item method, removing the original behavior. It helped me add a safe default validate_on_add() to the base class so subclasses didn’t break. I also asked why EBook() was giving a “takes no arguments” error; AI pointed out that I had accidentally defined the class twice, so Python was using the wrong version. AI also clarified that it was correct for different item types to override can_checkout(), so long as the base class provided a consistent interface. Overall, AI helped me clean up the structure of my classes and understand how the polymorphism in this week’s exercises is supposed to work.

Week 10
This week I focused on strengthening my understanding of Python’s data model, especially how properties and container behaviors make classes feel more “real.” I started by practicing a simple @property setter that cleans up a book title by stripping whitespace and raising a ValueError if the result is empty. It helped me see why validation inside setters keeps objects consistent. I also learned how to add a read-only property, like label, that returns a formatted string such as "Title [ISBN]". For containers, I tested how len(catalog) updates after deleting a book using __delitem__. A simple before-and-after assertion showed that my container class behaves like built-in Python collections. Lastly, I explored formatting challenges, like handling very long book titles when printing tables. Truncating with an ellipsis ("...") keeps the catalog readable without losing meaning, which reminded me that practical design is just as important as technical correctness.
